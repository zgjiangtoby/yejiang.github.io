I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Information and Technology, Qingdao University of Science and Technology ([QUST](https://www.qust.edu.cn/)). 
Prior to joining QUST, I was a Research Associate at [GATE NLP](https://gate.ac.uk/) group, Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, advised by [Prof. Kalina Bontcheva](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/K.Bontcheva/).
I also obtained my PhD at the University of Sheffield, supervised by [Dr. Diana Maynard](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/people/research-staff/diana-maynard).
My research centres on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, machine learning and social computing. I am particularly interested in developing a prompt-based algorithm and model for multimodal fake news detection.

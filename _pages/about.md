I am an Assistant Professor <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1fad1.png?v8" alt= "青年教师" width="20" height="20"> at the College of Information Science and Technology, Qingdao University of Science and Technology ([QUST](https://xk.qust.edu.cn/info/1041/4713.htm)).  Before joining QUST, I was a Research Associate for the SoBigData++ project and worked on the detection of online abuse, disinformation, and explainable AI (XAI) at [GATE NLP](https://gate.ac.uk/) group, Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Sheffield in 2021 with a thesis titled "Detecting Journalistic Framing and Attitudes on News Reporting about Climate Change". My PhD was funded by the Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures, where I was also a [Grantham Scholar](https://grantham.sheffield.ac.uk/scholars/ye-jiang-2/).  

My research interests lie in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and their intersections.

**🎓I am ACTIVELY looking for students to conduct research in the area of data mining, machine learning, social computing, and natural language processing. Interested students please feel free to drop me an email with your CV.**

I am an Assistant Professor <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1fad1.png?v8" alt= "青年教师" width="20" height="20"> at the School of Information Science and Technology, Qingdao University of Science and Technology ([QUST](https://www.qust.edu.cn/)).  Prior to joining QUST, I was a Research Associate for the SoBigData++ project and worked on the detection of online abuse, disinformation, and explainable AI (XAI) at [GATE NLP](https://gate.ac.uk/) group, Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield.  

I was awarded a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Sheffield with the thesis entitled "Detecting Journalistic Framing and Attitudes on News Reporting about Climate Change" in 2021. My PhD project was funded by the Grantham Centre for Sustainable Life and therefore I was lucky as a member of the [Grantham Scholar](https://grantham.sheffield.ac.uk/scholars/ye-jiang-2/).  

My research centres on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, machine learning and social computing, more specifically:

* Fake News, Misinformation Detection
* Text Representation Learning
* Social Computing
* Data Mining
* Few-shot Learning (Prompt-based)

**🎓I am always looking for highly motivated Master students interested in Machine Learning, Data Mining and Natural Language Processing.**
